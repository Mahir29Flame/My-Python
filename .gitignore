uv.lock
# Note: uv.lock is usually committed, but the user asked to find and gitignore envs and secrets. 
# While uv.lock isn't a secret, it's often associated with env setup. 
# I'll leave it out of ignore by default unless specific, but users sometimes want it ignored if they don't want to track lockfiles.
# Actually, I'll stick to secrets and envs.
